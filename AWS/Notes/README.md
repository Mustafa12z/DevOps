# üå•Ô∏è Introduction to Cloud Computing

## Understanding the Cloud

- **What is the Cloud?**
  - A **server** hosted somewhere that clients (web browsers) access via a **network** to visualize websites.
  - Clients and servers communicate using **IP addresses**.
  
- **Analogy**: 
  - Think of sending a letter:
    - **Client**: You (writing the letter)
    - **Network**: Postal system
    - **Server**: Your friend (the recipient)

- **Components of a Server**:
  - **CPU**: Performs computations (like the brain)
  - **RAM**: Fast memory for quick data access
  - **Storage**: For files and structured data (databases)
  - **Networking**: Routers, switches, and DNS servers

- **Challenges with Traditional IT**:
  - Costs: Rent, power, cooling, maintenance.
  - Scaling: Limited by physical space and time to acquire new servers.
  - Disasters: Vulnerability to events like earthquakes or fires.

# üõ°Ô∏è IAM (Identity and Access Management)

### Overview
- IAM stands for **Identity and Access Management**.
- It is a **global service** where we create users and assign them to groups.
- When creating an AWS account, a **root account** is automatically created. 
  - This root user should only be used for initial setup and not for regular tasks.
  
### Users and Groups
- Each user represents one person within the organization.
- Users can be grouped for easier management:
  - **Example**: In an organization with six people (Alice, Bob, Charles, David, Edward, Fred):
    - **Developers Group**: Alice, Bob, and Charles.
    - **Operations Group**: David and Edward.
- Groups can only contain users; they cannot contain other groups.
- A user can belong to multiple groups.
- Users not in a group is possible but not a best practice.

### Permissions
- Users or groups are assigned **IAM policies**, which are JSON documents defining allowed actions.
- **Example Policy**:
  - Allows users to:
    - Use the EC2 service and perform describe actions.
    - Use the Elastic Load Balancing service and perform describe actions.
    - Use CloudWatch.
- AWS follows the **principle of least privilege**:
  - Only grant permissions that a user needs.
  - Avoid giving users unrestricted access to prevent high costs or security vulnerabilities.

### IAM Policies
- When a policy is attached to a group (e.g., Developers), all members inherit that policy.
- Users can have **inline policies** attached directly, independent of group memberships.
- **Example**: If Charles and David are in the audit team, they will inherit that policy in addition to their respective group policies.

### Policy Structure
- IAM policy structure consists of:
  - **Version**: Usually `2012-10-17`.
  - **ID**: Optional identifier for the policy.
  - **Statements**: One or more statements.
  
Each statement includes:
- **Sid**: Optional statement identifier.
- **Effect**: Whether the statement allows or denies access (e.g., allow or deny).
- **Principal**: Accounts, users, or roles to which the policy applies.
- **Action**: List of API calls that are allowed or denied.
- **Resource**: List of resources to which the actions apply.
- **Condition**: Optional criteria for when the statement should apply.

---

## Protecting Users and Groups in IAM üîê

### Defense Mechanisms
1. **Password Policy**
   - A strong password increases security for your accounts.
   - In AWS, you can set up a password policy with various options:
     - **Minimum Password Length**: Define the minimum number of characters.
     - **Character Types**: Require specific character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, non-alphanumeric).
     - **User Password Change**: Allow users to change their passwords or require them to change after a certain period (e.g., every 90 days).
     - **Prevent Password Reuse**: Users cannot revert to previous passwords when changing.
   - A password policy helps protect against brute force attacks.

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - MFA adds an additional layer of security beyond just a password.
   - Users should enable MFA, especially for accounts with higher privileges, to prevent unauthorized access.
   - MFA combines something you know (password) with something you own (security device).
   - **Example**: Alice knows her password and has an MFA device generating a token for login.

### Benefits of MFA
- If Alice‚Äôs password is stolen, her account remains secure as a hacker would also need her physical MFA device (e.g., a phone) to log in.

### MFA Device Options in AWS
- Familiarize yourself with these options for the exam:
  1. **Virtual MFA Device**: 
     - Use apps like Google Authenticator or Authy.
     - Supports multiple tokens on a single device.
  2. **Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) Security Key**: 
     - A physical device, like a YubiKey by Yubico, allowing multiple users with one key.
  3. **Hardware Key Fob MFA Device**: 
     - Examples include devices from Gemalto, which are third-party providers.
  4. **Government Cloud MFA**: 
     - Special key fob provided by SurePassID for users of AWS GovCloud.

---

## Accessing AWS
There are three main ways to access AWS:

1. **Management Console** (Web Interface)
   - Protected by username, password, and possibly MFA.
   
2. **Command Line Interface (CLI)**  
   - Allows interaction with AWS services through terminal commands.
   - Requires **access keys** (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) for authentication.
   - Example:
     - `aws s3 cp` to copy files in S3.
   - Access keys are private and should never be shared. Treat your Access Key ID like a username and your Secret Access Key like a password.

3. **Software Development Kit (SDK)**
   - Allows API calls to AWS from within your code.
   - Different SDKs exist for various programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, JavaScript, .NET).
   - Example: The **AWS CLI** itself is built on **Boto**, the AWS SDK for Python.
   
---

### CLI Overview
- The CLI enables direct access to AWS services via public APIs.
- Useful for automating tasks and managing resources through scripting.
- It's open-source and available on GitHub.

### SDK Overview
- The SDK is integrated into your application to manage AWS services programmatically.
- Available for languages like Python, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, and more.
- Specialized SDKs exist for mobile (Android, iOS) and IoT devices.

## IAM Roles

IAM Roles allow AWS services to perform actions on your behalf. Just like users, services need permissions, and these are granted through IAM Roles.

#### What are IAM Roles?
- IAM Roles function similarly to users but are designed for AWS services rather than people.
- AWS services (like EC2 instances or Lambda functions) use these roles to get permissions to perform actions on AWS resources.

#### Example: EC2 Instance Roles
- When we launch an **EC2 Instance** (a virtual server), it may need to interact with other AWS services.
- To allow the EC2 instance to perform actions, we assign it an IAM Role.
  - The role gives the EC2 instance the permissions it needs.
  - Example: If the role allows it, the EC2 instance can retrieve information or perform tasks on AWS.
  
#### Common IAM Role Use Cases:
- **EC2 Instance Roles** ‚Äì Allow EC2 instances to access other AWS services.
- **Lambda Function Roles** ‚Äì Provide AWS Lambda functions with the necessary permissions.
- **CloudFormation Roles** ‚Äì Allow CloudFormation to manage AWS resources on your behalf.

---

## IAM Security Tools

IAM offers several security tools to help manage and monitor user credentials and access within your AWS account.

#### 1. IAM Credentials Report
- **Account-level report** that includes all users in your account.
- Provides the status of their credentials (e.g., passwords, access keys).
- Helps you review and monitor credential usage across your AWS account.

#### 2. IAM Access Advisor
- **User-level tool** that shows service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.
- Useful for applying the **principle of least privilege** by identifying unused permissions and adjusting user access accordingly.

These tools are essential for maintaining security and ensuring users have the appropriate permissions within your AWS account.

---

## Shared Responsibility Model for IAM

The **Shared Responsibility Model** for IAM outlines what AWS is responsible for and what falls under your responsibility when it comes to managing identity and access in the cloud.

#### AWS Responsibilities
- **Infrastructure security:** AWS manages the underlying infrastructure, including physical security and the global network.
- **Service availability:** AWS ensures the availability and security of IAM as a service.
- **Compliance of IAM services:** AWS is responsible for ensuring that IAM services meet industry compliance standards.

#### Customer Responsibilities
- **User, Group, and Role Management:** You are responsible for creating and managing users, groups, roles, and policies in IAM.
- **Policy Management:** Defining, attaching, and managing policies is your responsibility.
- **MFA Enforcement:** You must enable and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on accounts.
- **Access Key Rotation:** Regular rotation of access keys is required to ensure security, and you must manage this.
- **Permissions Management:** Applying the principle of least privilege and ensuring the correct permissions are assigned to users, groups, and roles is your responsibility.
- **Access Monitoring:** Reviewing IAM permissions, auditing access patterns, and revoking unnecessary access is up to you, not AWS.

---

## IAM Best Practices

To ensure proper management and security when using IAM, here are some best practices:

- **Avoid using the root account:** Use your root account only for initial setup. Create individual IAM users for everyday tasks.
- **One user per person:** Ensure that each person using AWS has their own IAM user. Do not share credentials between users.
- **Use groups for permissions:** Assign users to groups and manage permissions at the group level to maintain security and simplify access management.
- **Implement strong password policies:** Create and enforce a strong password policy to secure user access.
- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Require MFA for all users, especially for sensitive roles, to protect against unauthorized access.
- **Use IAM roles for AWS services:** When providing access to AWS services, such as EC2 instances, always use IAM roles instead of credentials.
- **Secure access keys:** If you are using AWS programmatically (CLI or SDK), generate access keys and treat them like passwords. Keep them secret and do not share them.
- **Review permissions regularly:** Use the IAM credentials report and IAM Access Advisor to audit permissions and remove unnecessary access.
- **Never share IAM credentials:** Do not share IAM users or access keys. Keep them private to maintain security.


# üíº AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

### What is Amazon EC2?
- **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** is a service that allows you to rent virtual servers, known as **EC2 instances**, on demand. It provides scalable compute power in the cloud and is fundamental for understanding AWS and cloud computing.
- EC2 is part of the **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** model, where you can launch and manage virtual machines with flexible configurations.

---

### Key EC2 Components
1. **EC2 Instances**:  
   - Virtual machines that can run various operating systems such as **Linux**, **Windows**, or even **Mac OS**.
   
2. **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**:  
   - Network-attached storage that can be used for persistent data storage.
   
3. **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**:  
   - Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances for high availability and fault tolerance.
   
4. **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**:  
   - Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on the current demand.

---

### EC2 Instance Configuration Options
- When launching an EC2 instance, several configuration options are available:
  1. **Operating System (OS)**: Choose between Linux, Windows, or Mac OS.
  2. **Compute Power**: Select the number of **vCPUs** (virtual CPUs) and **RAM** based on the requirements of your workload.
  3. **Storage Options**:
     - **EBS (Elastic Block Store)** or **EFS (Elastic File System)** for network-attached storage.
     - **Instance Store** for storage directly attached to the physical hardware.
  4. **Networking**: Choose the type of **network card**, set up **firewall rules** with **Security Groups**, and assign a **public IP** if needed.
  5. **EC2 User Data**: Run a **bootstrap script** during the instance's first launch to automate tasks like installing updates, software, or downloading files.

---

### Bootstrapping with EC2 User Data
- **Bootstrapping** refers to running commands or scripts when the instance is launched for the first time.
  - This script is called **EC2 User Data** and is only executed once, allowing you to automate tasks like:
    - Installing software and updates.
    - Configuring system settings.
    - Downloading necessary files.
  - The **EC2 User Data** runs as the **root user**, meaning all commands have administrative privileges.

---

### EC2 Instance Examples
- EC2 provides a wide range of instance types to suit various workloads. These instances vary in terms of CPU, memory, network performance, and storage options. Here are a few examples:
  
  1. **t2.micro**:
     - **vCPU**: 1

## Security Groups and Ports

### Overview
Security Groups act as firewalls for EC2 instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic. They are a fundamental part of AWS network security.

- **Allow Rules Only**: Security Groups only contain allow rules, specifying what traffic can enter or leave an EC2 instance.
- **IP or Security Group Reference**: Rules can reference IP addresses or other security groups.

### Inbound and Outbound Rules
- **Inbound Traffic**: Controls what is allowed to enter the EC2 instance (e.g., access from your computer).
- **Outbound Traffic**: Controls what traffic the EC2 instance is allowed to send out (e.g., accessing external websites).

### Security Group Features
- **Region/VPC Specific**: Security Groups are tied to specific regions or VPCs. You must create new security groups when changing regions or VPCs.
- **Shared Across Instances**: One Security Group can be applied to multiple instances, and instances can have multiple security groups.
- **Firewall Outside EC2**: Security Groups operate outside the EC2 instance, meaning blocked traffic won't even reach the instance.

### Good Practice
- **Separate SSH Security Group**: It's a good practice to create a separate security group just for SSH access.

### Common Ports
- **SSH (Secure Shell)**: Port 22, used to log into Linux EC2 instances.
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: Port 21, for uploading files to a file share.
- **SFTP (Secure FTP)**: Port 22, for secure file transfer using SSH.
- **HTTP**: Port 80, for accessing unsecured websites.
- **HTTPS**: Port 443, for accessing secured websites.
- **RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)**: Port 3389, for logging into Windows instances.

### Advanced Feature: Security Group References
- **Security Group to Security Group Communication**: You can reference one security group in the inbound rules of another. This allows EC2 instances with specific security groups to communicate directly, without needing to manage IP addresses.

#### Example:
Imagine you have two EC2 instances:
1. **EC2 Instance A** with **Security Group A**.
2. **EC2 Instance B** with **Security Group B**.

To allow **Instance B** to communicate with **Instance A**, you would set an inbound rule on **Security Group A** like this:
- **Type**: Custom TCP Rule
- **Protocol**: TCP
- **Port Range**: 8080 (or any port your application uses)
- **Source**: Security Group B

This allows all EC2 instances with **Security Group B** attached to them to communicate with instances that have **Security Group A** attached, through the specified port (8080 in this case). 

You don't need to worry about the IP addresses of the EC2 instances; the security group reference handles it.

## EC2 Instance Purchasing Options

AWS offers several purchasing options for EC2 instances based on workload requirements, cost optimization, and usage predictability. Here are the primary purchasing options:

#### 1. **On-Demand Instances**
- **Description**: On-demand instances allow you to pay for compute capacity by the second, with no long-term commitments or upfront payments.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for short-term, unpredictable workloads.
- **Example**: You are running a web server during a product launch that could last a few hours or days, but you don't want long-term commitments.
  
#### 2. **Reserved Instances**
- **Description**: Reserved instances are designed for long-term workloads where you can commit to using the instance for a one- or three-year term, offering significant discounts.
- **Types**:
  - **Standard Reserved Instances**: Up to 72% discount, specific to instance type and region.
  - **Convertible Reserved Instances**: Up to 66% discount, with the flexibility to change instance family or type.
- **Example**: You are running a database that you know will be active for at least three years. You purchase a reserved instance for the long-term and get up to 72% off the on-demand price.

#### 3. **Savings Plans**
- **Description**: Similar to reserved instances but more flexible. You commit to a specific amount of usage (in dollars) over one or three years, regardless of instance type.
- **Use Case**: Long-term, steady-state workloads with flexible instance types and regions.
- **Example**: You commit to spending $300 per month across any EC2 instances in the **m5 family** within **us-east-1** for the next three years.

#### 4. **Spot Instances**
- **Description**: Spot instances are unused EC2 capacity that AWS offers at up to 90% discount, but they can be interrupted with minimal warning.
- **Use Case**: Best suited for fault-tolerant, flexible workloads that can handle interruptions.
- **Example**: You are running image processing tasks that can stop and resume without issue, so you use spot instances to save 90% on costs.

#### 5. **Dedicated Hosts**
- **Description**: This option gives you a physical server fully dedicated to your usage, allowing full control of instance placements and access to the underlying hardware.
- **Use Case**: Required for companies with regulatory or compliance needs or for using your own licensing (e.g., BYOL - Bring Your Own License).
- **Example**: Your organization has strict compliance requirements and needs visibility into the physical server hosting your instances.

#### 6. **Dedicated Instances**
- **Description**: These instances run on hardware dedicated to a single customer, but you don‚Äôt get access to the physical server. It is different from a dedicated host in terms of control and placement.
- **Use Case**: If you need physical isolation for your instances without managing the physical host.
- **Example**: You want hardware that isn‚Äôt shared with other AWS customers, but you don‚Äôt need full control over the host.

#### 7. **Capacity Reservations**
- **Description**: You reserve capacity in a specific availability zone (AZ) for any duration. This guarantees that the capacity is available whenever needed but does not offer any pricing discounts.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for applications that need guaranteed capacity in a particular region but are uncertain about when it will be used.
- **Example**: You are planning a high-traffic event in the near future and want to ensure enough compute capacity is available in a specific AZ during the event.
