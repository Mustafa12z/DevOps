## What is Linux in Relation to DevOps?

Linux is the backbone of many DevOps workflows, as it powers the servers and cloud environments where applications run. Its open-source nature, stability, and extensive command-line tools make it the main choice for automating infrastructure, managing services, and ensuring smooth operations.

In the DevOps ecosystem, Linux is commonly used with:

- **Docker** 🐳: Containers often run on Linux environments due to its lightweight and scalable nature.
- **Kubernetes** ☸️: Orchestrates containers that are typically based on Linux distributions.
- **Ansible** ⚙️: Automates configuration management and deployment using Linux systems.
- **Terraform** 🌍: Linux servers are frequently provisioned using infrastructure as code tools like Terraform.
- **CI/CD Tools** 🔄: Many continuous integration and deployment tools rely on Linux for automated builds, tests, and deployments.
- **Monitoring Tools** 📊: Monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana integrate seamlessly with Linux servers to track performance and logs.

In DevOps, mastering Linux is key to efficiently managing these tools and processes, making it the foundation for smooth operations and automation.

## OverTheWire Bandit Game

The OverTheWire Bandit game has been the starting point for learning Linux. It consists of a series of challenges designed to teach basic Linux commands and system interaction. Bandit focuses on command-line skills, navigation, file manipulation, permissions, networking, and more advanced topics as you progress through each level.

### How I'll Provide the Answers

For each level of the Bandit game, I'll provide:

1. **The Goal**: A clear explanation of what needs to be achieved.
2. **The Solution**: A step-by-step breakdown of the commands and processes used to complete the level.
